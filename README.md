# Text Completion and Prediction Model using NLP
This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed for text completion and text prediction tasks. The model leverages the power of pre-trained language models to predict missing parts of sentences or complete partial sentences, making it useful for a wide variety of applications, including content generation, chatbots, and other text-based tasks.

# üõ†Ô∏è Features
Text Completion: Predicts the next word or phrase to complete a given sentence or partial text.
Text Prediction: Provides predictions for missing or masked words in a sentence.
Customizable: Easily adjust the model for specific use cases or domains.
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes powerful language models from Hugging Face's transformers library, reducing the need for heavy training.

# üöÄ Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. You can install the required dependencies via pip using the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install the core dependencies directly with:

bash
Copy
pip install torch transformers pandas

##üì¶ Usage
# Example Code
You can use this model by providing a sentence or text and getting back the completed or predicted version of it.

python
Copy
from transformers import pipeline

# Load model for text completion and prediction
fillmask = pipeline(task="fill-mask", model="bert-base-uncased")

# Example sentence for testing
sentence = "The nurse is examining the patient. [MASK] is writing down notes."

# Get predictions
predictions = fillmask(sentence)
for prediction in predictions:
    print(prediction)
üîß How it Works
Tokenizer: The input text is first tokenized, converting the words into numerical representations that the model can process.
Model: A pre-trained model (such as BERT, GPT-2, etc.) processes the tokenized text, leveraging its learned knowledge to predict the masked or missing parts of the input.
Output: The model outputs possible predictions for the missing or masked word(s), which can be used for text completion or prediction tasks.
